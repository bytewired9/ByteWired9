# Hey there! 👋 I'm ByteWired9

I'm just a regular human who loves to 🎮 play video games. If there's a tedious task, best believe I'm trying to find a way to automate it. Because, who's got time for all that manual stuff? And yep, I'm still figuring things out, making mistakes, and studenting. (Yep, that's a word now. 😉)

## 💼 What I Play With
- **Operating System**: Good ol' Windows
- **Languages I Know**: A bit of Node.js, Python, and some HTML magic

## 🎈 Some Stuff I Made
